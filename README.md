# Stock-Market-Prediction

- This Project proposes to use supervised machine learning  algorithms to predict the future stock price for exchange by  using open source libraries and pre existing algorithms to  help make this unpredictable format of business a little  more predictable.

- The outcome is completely based on  numbers and assumes a lot of axioms that may or may not  follow in the real world so as the time of prediction.
